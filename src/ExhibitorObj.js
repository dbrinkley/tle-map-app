There are many ways to measure progress and to us the most meaningful sign is the presence of previously unused desert plants in thoughtful landscapes throughout the Southwest. These landscapes range from large-scale projects to simple private gardens each quietly recognizing our deserts as places of great beauty diversity and well-springs of life.The use of desert-adapted plants as landscape materials has evolved from the selection of our durable natives which served to anchor difficult and demanding revegetation sites to an ongoing and continuous search for beauty color and variety. In todays landscapes our plant choices have broadened to include hues and forms which far surpass our earlier hopes of adding texture refinement brilliance-pizzazz if you will-to already proven durability.This evolution and refinement has progressed on many fronts in step with education and much like a partnership together they have established a foundation for greater appreciation and acceptance of desert-adapted plants across the southwestern United States.Without the educational programs sponsored by so many organizations and institutions and without the contributions of enthusiastic writers the knowledge and pleasure of landscaping with this diverse palette would have remained limited to isolated pockets of enthusiasts. Instead the combined efforts of many individuals have resulted in a unique plant palette that provides a distinct sense of place.To assist you in your selection process Mountain States Wholesale Nursery offers over 450 taxa of desert-adapted trees shrubs ornamental grasses accents flowering perennials groundcovers and vines. We specialize in providing landscape plants that combine beauty and water economy. It is our goal to provide quality plant material to allow the fulfillment of design concepts that reflect the spirit and the beauty of the desert.We cordially invite wholesale customers to visit out nursery explore the wide variety of possibilities found here and allow us to introduce you to our large inventory of landscape plants collected from the deserts of the world.
